# Simple-C-reverse-tcp-shell
A simple reverse tcp shell written in C.

First attempt in programming this kind of programs in C. Feel free to contribute or give some feedback if you see something which could be done more efficiently.

**Note**: Although this program is conceptual, just for proof of concept and shouldn't be used to damage other's property, computer etc. It is technically possible to do so. I won't be held responsible for any harm which could be caused by use of this program.
