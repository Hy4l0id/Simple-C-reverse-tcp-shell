# Simple-C-reverse-tcp-shell
A simple reverse tcp shell written in C.

Mostly made out of snippets found on the internet (different functions etc.) and put together.
Not very stable, but it 'works'.


Note: It's conceptual, just for proof of concept, and shouldn't be used to damage other's property, computer etc. I won't be held responsible for any harm which could be caused by use of this program.
